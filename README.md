## USER build story

For this project I wanted to create a logo maker that would create logos as SVG files for future projects, and assignments.  I made It so that it would be capable of picking between a circle, square, or triangle for the background image.  It would allow me to input the text I wanted to put for it, and to be able to change the color for both the image, and the text.  I was able to achieve this using node, and Java.  I also was able to use the input suite for inquier, and the test suite jest to test this out. After creation of the new SVG files I also got them to be saved to a folder called examples to be able to catelog any new emblems created.  This is going to be a very handy application to be able to use for future projects, and I would like to make changes for it in the future.  I followed these acceptance criteria.  

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

I have completed these to the best of my ability, and have showcased this off on the git hub, and made a video showing the functionality of the assignment. located at the links below.

## In the future

For the future of the application, I would like to be able to add more shapes to be used to label creation.  I think that this would be able to keep using it well into the future  for many future projects and assignments!
